  abstract  = "Summary Tropical forest above‐ground wood production (AGWP)
               varies substantially along environmental gradients. Some
               evidence suggests that AGWP may vary between regions and
               specifically that Asian forests have particularly high AGWP.
               However, comparisons across biogeographic regions using
               standardized methods are lacking, limiting our assessment of
               pan‐tropical variation in AGWP and potential causes. We sampled
               AGWP in NW Amazon (17 long‐term forest plots) and N Borneo (11
               plots), both with abundant year‐round precipitation. Within each
               region, forests growing on a broad range of edaphic conditions
               were sampled using standardized soil and forest measurement
               techniques. Plot‐level AGWP was 49\% greater in Borneo than in
               Amazonia (9.73 $\pm$ 0.56 vs. 6.53 $\pm$ 0.34 Mg dry mass ha−1
               a−1, respectively; regional mean $\pm$ 1 SE). AGWP was
               positively associated with soil fertility (PCA axes, sum of
               bases and total P). After controlling for the edaphic
               environment, AGWP remained significantly higher in Bornean
               plots. Differences in AGWP were largely attributable to
               differing height--diameter allometry in the two regions and the
               abundance of large trees in Borneo. This may be explained, in
               part, by the greater solar radiation in Borneo compared with NW
               Amazonia. Trees belonging to the dominant SE Asian family,
               Dipterocarpaceae, gained woody biomass faster than otherwise
               equivalent, neighbouring non‐dipterocarps, implying that the
               exceptional production of Bornean forests may be driven by
               floristic elements. This dominant SE Asian family may partition
               biomass differently or be more efficient at harvesting resources
               and in converting them to woody biomass. Synthesis. N Bornean
               forests have much greater AGWP rates than those in NW Amazon
               when soil conditions and rainfall are controlled for. Greater
               resource availability and the highly productive dipterocarps
               may, in combination, explain why Asian forests produce wood half
               as fast again as comparable forests in the Amazon. Our results
               also suggest that taxonomic groups differ in their fundamental
               ability to capture carbon and that different tropical regions
               may therefore have different carbon uptake capacities due to
               biogeographic history.",

               consequences. Here, we review the state of knowledge regarding
               MTF tree mortality, create a conceptual framework with testable
               hypotheses regarding the drivers, mechanisms and interactions
               that may underlie increasing MTF mortality rates, and identify
               the next steps for improved understanding and reduced
               prediction. Increasing mortality rates are associated with
               rising temperature and vapor pressure deficit, liana abundance,
               drought, wind events, fire and, possibly, CO2
               fertilization‐induced increases in stand thinning or
               acceleration of trees reaching larger, more vulnerable heights.
               The majority of these mortality drivers may kill trees in part
               through carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. The relative
               importance of each driver is unknown. High species diversity may
               buffer MTFs against large‐scale mortality events, but recent and
               expected trends in mortality drivers give reason for concern
               regarding increasing mortality within MTFs. Models of tropical
               tree mortality are advancing the representation of hydraulics,
               carbon and demography, but require more empirical knowledge

               mechanisms. We outline critical datasets and model developments

               empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85
               publications for the period 1960--2003. We screened each
               publication for terms that were used to define habitat
               heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied,
               the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of
               vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the
               study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive
               correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal
               species diversity. However, empirical support for this
               relationship is drastically biased towards studies of
               vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this
               paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity
               may vary considerably between species groups depending on
               whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or
               fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the
               structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a
               classification framework that may be used for across-studies
               comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for
               one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale.
               In several studies, however, different species groups are
               closely linked to `keystone structures' that determine animal
               species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone
               structures of the vegetation has profound implications for
               nature conservation and biodiversity management.",

               tree growth in mature tropical forests are needed to evaluate
               the functional impact of lianas and their potential to affect
               the ability of tropical forests to sequester carbon, but these
               are currently lacking. Using data collected on tree growth
               rates, local growing conditions and liana competition in five
               permanent sampling plots in Amazonian Peru, we present the first
               ecosystem-level estimates of the effect of lianas on
               above-ground productivity of trees. By first constructing a
               multi-level linear mixed effect model to predict individual-tree
               diameter growth model using individual-tree growth conditions,
               we were able to then estimate stand-level above-ground biomass
               (AGB) increment in the absence of lianas. We show that lianas,
               mainly by competing above-ground with trees, reduce tree annual
               above-ground stand-level biomass increment by ~10\%, equivalent
               to 0.51 Mg dry weight ha−1 yr−1 or 0.25 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. AGB
               increment of lianas themselves was estimated to be 0.15 Mg dry
               weight ha−1 yr−1 or 0.07 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, thus only compensating
               ~29\% of the liana-induced reduction in ecosystem AGB increment.
               Increasing liana pressure on tropical forests will therefore not
               only tend to reduce their carbon storage capacity, by indirectly
               promoting tree species with low-density wood, but also their
               rate of carbon uptake, with potential consequences for the rate
               of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.",

  abstract  = "Drought and fire reduce productivity and increase tree mortality
               in tropical forests. Fires also produce pyrogenic carbon (PyC),
               which persists in situ for centuries to millennia, and
               represents a legacy of past fires, potentially improving soil
               fertility and water holding capacity and selecting for the
               survival and recruitment of certain tree life-history (or
               successional) strategies. We investigated whether PyC is
               correlated with physicochemical soil properties, wood density,
               aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics and forest resistance to
               severe drought. To achieve our aim, we used an Amazon-wide,
               long-term plot network, in forests without known recent fires,
               integrating site-specific measures of forest dynamics, soil
               properties and a unique soil PyC concentration database. We
               found that forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC had
               both higher soil fertility and lower wood density. Soil PyC was
               not associated with AGC dynamics in non-drought years. However,
               during extreme drought events (10\% driest years), forests with
               higher concentrations of soil PyC experienced lower reductions
               in AGC gains (woody growth and recruitment), with this
               drought-immunizing effect increasing with drought severity.
               Forests with a legacy of ancient fires are therefore more likely
               to continue to grow and recruit under increased drought
               severity. Forests with high soil PyC concentrations (third
               quartile) had 3.8\% greater AGC gains under mean drought, but
               33.7\% greater under the most extreme drought than forests with
               low soil PyC concentrations (first quartile), offsetting losses
               of up to 0.68 Mg C ha--1yr--1 of AGC under extreme drought
               events. This suggests that ancient fires have legacy effects on
               current forest dynamics, by altering soil fertility and favoring
               tree species capable of continued growth and recruitment during
               droughts. Therefore, mature forest that experienced fires
               centuries or millennia ago may have greater resistance to
               current short-term droughts.",

  abstract  = "To quantify the effects of land cover changes in the Amazon on
               local and global climate, numerical simulation experiments using
               the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model II global climate
               model are conducted. An ensemble approach is adopted, in which a
               group of six control simulations is compared with a group of six
               deforested simulations. The deforestation effect in the Amazon
               is strong, with reductions in precipitation, evapotranspiration,
               and cloudiness. We also detect a noticeable impact in several
               other regions of the world, several of which show a reduction in
               rainy season precipitation that exhibits a high signal‐to‐noise
               ratio (determined by the t statistic). To determine the
               significance of the deforestation signal, we create several
               ``false'' ensembles, combining control and deforested members
               randomly, for comparison with the actual ``true'' ensemble. Such
               an analysis has not been used previously in deforestation
               studies and is useful for verifying the significance of a
               purported effect. The globally averaged precipitation deficits
               for the true ensemble are generally high in comparison with the
               false ensembles. Furthermore, changes in the Amazon due to the
               deforestation correlate significantly with remote changes in
               several areas. This suggests that the Amazon deforestation is
               producing a detectable signal throughout the Earth, and this
               finding underscores the importance of human activity in that
               region.",
