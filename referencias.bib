  abstract  = "Protected areas (PAs) are key elements for biodiversity
               conservation and ecosystem services. Brazil has the largest PA
               system in the world, covering approximately 220 million ha. This
               system expanded rapidly in the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.
               Recent events in Brazil, however, have led to an increase in PA
               downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD). Does this
               reflect a shift in the country's PA policy? We analyzed the
               occurrence, frequency, magnitude, type, spatial distribution,
               and causes of changes in PA boundaries and categories in Brazil.
               We identified 93 PADDD events from 1981 to 2012. Such events
               increased in frequency since 2008 and were ascribed primarily to
               generation and transmission of electricity in Amazonia. In
               Brazilian parks and reserves, 7.3 million ha were affected by
               PADDD events, and of these, 5.2 million ha were affected by
               downsizing or degazetting. Moreover, projects being considered
               by the Federal Congress may degazette 2.1 million ha of PA in
               Amazonia alone. Relaxing the protection status of existing PAs
               is proving to be politically easy in Brazil, and the recent
               increase in frequency and extension of PADDD reflects a change
               in governmental policy. By taking advantage of chronic
               deficiencies in financial and personnel resources and
               surveillance, disputes over land tenure, and the slowness of the
               Brazilian justice, government agencies have been implementing
               PADDD without consultation of civil society. If parks and
               reserves are to maintain their integrity, there will need to be
               investments in Brazilian PAs and a better understanding of the
               benefits PAs provide.",

  author    = "Jusys, Tomas",
  abstract  = "This study explores the main direct and underlying causes of
               deforestation in Brazil's Legal Amazon region by considering
               spatial differences. The computation of localized parameters is
               based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). The novelty
               of this paper lies in its incorporation of economic, rather than
               Euclidean, distances into the GWR. Economic distances are
               measured by travel time, sourced from Google Inc. A global
               approach revealed several important factors that affect
               deforestation, including: rural population, GDP (suggesting a
               U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve), forest stock, cattle
               ranching, timber value, and road networks (both official and
               unofficial). Local analysis uncovered patterns not seen under
               global models, especially in the state of Par{\'a}. Most
               notably, crop cultivation was found to accelerate deforestation
               in southeastern Par{\'a} and northeastern Mato Grosso, while in
               some regions (especially in the northeastern corner of
               Par{\'a}), the area covered by crop plantations was negatively
               associated with deforestation. For Par{\'a}, rural credit
               constraints, larger territories designated as sustainable use
               areas and indigenous lands, and higher levels of precipitation
               inhibit deforestation. Further, rural population has a very
               heterogeneous impact on deforestation across Legal Amazon: it is
               not a significant factor of deforestation in northern Par{\'a}
               and Amap{\'a}, but it has a relatively strong effect in the
               western parts of Mato Grosso and Rond{\^o}nia. Also, official
               and illegal roads create significantly more pressure on forests
               in remote regions compared to developed areas. Finally, the use
               of economic distances, as opposed to Euclidean distances, leads
               to notably different GWR results.",

               areas is an important piece of information for government

               non random location selection bias makes such information
               directly unobservable. To overcome this problem, propensity
               score matching was applied. Unlike in previous studies, impact
               of buffer zone management was assessed by estimating avoided
               deforestation in buffer zones and park edges. The study area is
               the state of Par{\'a}. Overall results revealed that park
               protection saved 0.72\% of protected surface from deforestation
               during 2000--2004 year period (∼2900 km2 of forests). The
               highest percentage of avoided deforestation was recorded in
               protected areas, situated near deforestation hotspots: central
               part of Eastern Par{\'a}, alongside Trans-Amazonian highway and
               on the banks of Amazon River. The findings also suggest that
               buffer zones tend to reduce deforestation where pressure on
               forests is lower, but substitution effect takes over in areas of
               high deforestation pressure (since loggers are prevented from
               deforesting within conservation units, deforestation in
               surrounding areas increases). Finally, the study does not find

  abstract  = "We provide a broad overview of the underlying philosophy of
               ecological monitoring. We argue that the major characteristics
               of effective monitoring programs typically include: (1) Good
               questions. (2) A conceptual model of an ecosystem or population.
               (3) Strong partnerships between scientists, policy-makers and
               managers. (4) Frequent use of data collected.We classify
               monitoring programs into three categories -- (1) Passive
               monitoring, which is devoid of specified questions or underlying
               study design and has limited rationale other than curiosity. (2)
               Mandated monitoring where environmental data are gathered as a
               stipulated requirement of government legislation or a political
               directive. The focus is usually to identify trends. (3)
               Question-driven monitoring, which is guided by a conceptual
               model and by a rigorous design that will typically result in a
               priori predictions that can be tested.There are advantages and
               disadvantages of mandated monitoring programs, which are
               typically large-scaled, and generally smaller-scaled,
               question-driven monitoring programs. For example, while
               question-driven monitoring programs can provide insights into
               the ecological processes giving rise to emergent environmental
               patterns, spatial generalization from them is difficult because
               results may not extrapolate well to other regions, states or to
               a national level. Conversely, while mandated monitoring can be
               useful for producing coarse level summaries of temporal changes
               in a target population or resource condition they may not

               from varied biodiversity observation sources. Here we
               demonstrate the links between data sources, EBVs and indicators
               and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations
               can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary
               observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring
               schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing.
               We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal
               coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring
               schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to
               deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the
               latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes
               mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver
               long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite
               remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information
               on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data
               sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity
               datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources
               and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps.
               We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living
               Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on
               EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring
               schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and
               North America and that ecological field studies play a key role
               in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will
               depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through
               data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the
               establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical
               data gaps.",

  abstract  = "Abstract More than 15\% of global terrestrial area is under some
               form of protection and there is a growing impetus to increase
               this coverage to 30\% by 2030. But not all protection is
               effective and the reasons some countries' protected areas (PAs)
               are more effective than others' are poorly understood. We
               evaluate the effectiveness of national PA networks established
               between 2000 and 2012 globally in avoiding forest loss, taking
               into account underlying deforestation threats using a
               combination of matching methods and cross-sectional regressions.
               We then assess which demographic, agricultural, economic, and
               governance factors are most strongly associated with national PA
               effectiveness using machine learning methods. We estimate that
               national PAs established between 2000 and 2012 reduced
               deforestation in those areas by 72\%, avoiding 86 062 km2 of
               forest loss. The effectiveness of national PAs varied by
               strictness of protection based on International Union for
               Conservation of Nature category. Strictly PAs reduced forest
               loss by 81\% compared to what would have occurred without
               protection, while less strictly PAs reduced forest loss by 67\%.
               Thus, the 26\% of new PAs that were strictly protected
               contributed 39\% of the total forest loss avoided within PAs
               between 2000 and 2012. If every country's PAs were as effective
               as the country with the most effective PAs within the same
               region, they would have increased the area of deforestation
               avoided by 38\%, saving a further 119 082 km2 of forest. Part of
               the variation in PA effectiveness across countries is explained
               by the placement of PA in areas facing higher deforestation
               threat. Countries with lower agricultural activity, higher
               economic growth and better governance are most strongly
               associated with greater country-level PA effectiveness.",
