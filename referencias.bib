               protected areas in Brazil",
  author    = "Bernard, E. and Penna, L. A. O. and Ara{\'u}jo, E.",
  abstract  = "Protected areas (PAs) are key elements for biodiversity
               conservation and ecosystem services. Brazil has the largest PA
               system in the world, covering approximately 220 million ha. This
               system expanded rapidly in the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.
               Recent events in Brazil, however, have led to an increase in PA
               downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD). Does this
               reflect a shift in the country's PA policy? We analyzed the
               occurrence, frequency, magnitude, type, spatial distribution,
               and causes of changes in PA boundaries and categories in Brazil.
               We identified 93 PADDD events from 1981 to 2012. Such events
               increased in frequency since 2008 and were ascribed primarily to
               generation and transmission of electricity in Amazonia. In
               Brazilian parks and reserves, 7.3 million ha were affected by
               PADDD events, and of these, 5.2 million ha were affected by
               downsizing or degazetting. Moreover, projects being considered
               by the Federal Congress may degazette 2.1 million ha of PA in
               Amazonia alone. Relaxing the protection status of existing PAs
               is proving to be politically easy in Brazil, and the recent
               increase in frequency and extension of PADDD reflects a change
               in governmental policy. By taking advantage of chronic
               deficiencies in financial and personnel resources and
               surveillance, disputes over land tenure, and the slowness of the
               Brazilian justice, government agencies have been implementing
               PADDD without consultation of civil society. If parks and
               reserves are to maintain their integrity, there will need to be
               investments in Brazilian PAs and a better understanding of the
               benefits PAs provide.",

               ecology and conservation",

               and Ehrlich, Paul R",
  abstract  = "Roughly 90\% of butterfly species live in the tropics. Despite
               this, we know very little about tropical butterfly ecology
               particularly when compared to temperate butterfly systems. The
               relative scarcity of data on tropical butterfly populations
               hampers our ability to effectively conserve them. In this review
               we summarize recurring themes from ecological research on
               tropical butterflies to serve as a framework for understanding
               their conservation. Key themes include: (1) the tropics
               represent the evolutionary origins of butterfly diversity, (2)
               while some tropical butterflies exhibit relatively stable
               population dynamics, longer-lived adult stages, and more
               continuous age-specific reproduction compared to temperate zone
               species, the generality of these patterns is debatable, and (3)
               complex species interactions (e.g. mimicry, parasitism and
               predation) can have significantly greater influences on
               ecological and evolutionary processes in tropical butterflies
               than in temperate ones. This state of ecological knowledge,
               combined with scarce resources, has traditionally constrained
               tropical butterfly conservation efforts to habitat level
               approaches, unlike the species- and population-specific
               approaches familiar in North America and Europe. Consequently,
               much conservation research on butterflies in the tropics has
               focused on the relationship between habitat quality (e.g. forest
               fragmentation) and butterfly diversity, though predictive
               patterns even in this regard remain elusive. We argue that with
               the increasing threats of habitat destruction, fragmentation and
               climate change, it is necessary to move beyond this diversity
               and habitat relationship if we are to improve predictive
               capabilities when evaluating anthropogenic impacts on tropical
               butterfly communities. Tropical butterflies are more than just
               useful indicator species. They represent some of the most
               spectacular and visually appealing organisms in the world and
               play many vital roles in tropical ecosystems. We hope that this
               synthesis will lay the groundwork for future ecological studies
               of tropical butterfly populations, species, communities and
               conservation.",

               environments is critical to ecology and conservation biology.
               Tropical forest insect faunas vary in space and time, and these
               partitions can differ in their contribution to overall species
               diversity. 2. In the Neotropics, the Central American butterfly
               fauna is best known in terms of general natural history, but
               butterfly community diversity is best documented by studies on
               South American fruit-feeding butterflies. Here, we present the
               first long-term study of fruit-feeding nymphalid species
               diversity from Central America and provide a unique comparison
               between Central and South American butterfly communities. 3.
               This study used 60 months of sampling among multiple spatial and
               temporal partitions to assess species diversity in a Costa Rican
               rainforest butterfly community. Abundance distributions varied
               significantly at the species and higher taxonomic group levels,
               and canopy and understorey samples were found to be composed of
               distinct species assemblages. 4. Strong similarities in patterns
               of species diversity were found between this study and one from
               Ecuador; yet, there was an important difference in how species
               richness was distributed in vertical space. In contrast to the
               Ecuadorian site, Costa Rica had significantly higher canopy
               richness and lower understorey richness. 5. This study affirms
               that long-term sampling is vital to understanding tropical
               insect species abundance distributions and points to potential
               differences in vertical structure among Central and South
               American forest insect communities that need to be explored.",

  abstract  = "This study explores the main direct and underlying causes of
               deforestation in Brazil's Legal Amazon region by considering
               spatial differences. The computation of localized parameters is
               based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). The novelty
               of this paper lies in its incorporation of economic, rather than
               Euclidean, distances into the GWR. Economic distances are
               measured by travel time, sourced from Google Inc. A global
               approach revealed several important factors that affect
               deforestation, including: rural population, GDP (suggesting a
               U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve), forest stock, cattle
               ranching, timber value, and road networks (both official and
               unofficial). Local analysis uncovered patterns not seen under
               global models, especially in the state of Pará}. Most
               notably, crop cultivation was found to accelerate deforestation
               in southeastern Pará} and northeastern Mato Grosso, while in
               some regions (especially in the northeastern corner of
               Pará}), the area covered by crop plantations was negatively
               associated with deforestation. For Pará}, rural credit
               constraints, larger territories designated as sustainable use
               areas and indigenous lands, and higher levels of precipitation
               inhibit deforestation. Further, rural population has a very
               heterogeneous impact on deforestation across Legal Amazon: it is
               not a significant factor of deforestation in northern Pará}
               and Amapá}, but it has a relatively strong effect in the
               western parts of Mato Grosso and Rondônia. Also, official
               and illegal roads create significantly more pressure on forests
               in remote regions compared to developed areas. Finally, the use
               of economic distances, as opposed to Euclidean distances, leads
               to notably different GWR results.",

               areas is an important piece of information for government

               non random location selection bias makes such information
               directly unobservable. To overcome this problem, propensity
               score matching was applied. Unlike in previous studies, impact
               of buffer zone management was assessed by estimating avoided
               deforestation in buffer zones and park edges. The study area is
               the state of Par{\'a}. Overall results revealed that park
               protection saved 0.72\% of protected surface from deforestation
               during 2000--2004 year period (∼2900 km2 of forests). The
               highest percentage of avoided deforestation was recorded in
               protected areas, situated near deforestation hotspots: central
               part of Eastern Par{\'a}, alongside Trans-Amazonian highway and
               on the banks of Amazon River. The findings also suggest that
               buffer zones tend to reduce deforestation where pressure on
               forests is lower, but substitution effect takes over in areas of
               high deforestation pressure (since loggers are prevented from
               deforesting within conservation units, deforestation in
               surrounding areas increases). Finally, the study does not find

               Question-driven monitoring, which is guided by a conceptual
               model and by a rigorous design that will typically result in a
               priori predictions that can be tested.There are advantages and
               disadvantages of mandated monitoring programs, which are
               typically large-scaled, and generally smaller-scaled,
               question-driven monitoring programs. For example, while
               question-driven monitoring programs can provide insights into
               the ecological processes giving rise to emergent environmental
               patterns, spatial generalization from them is difficult because
               results may not extrapolate well to other regions, states or to
               a national level. Conversely, while mandated monitoring can be
               useful for producing coarse level summaries of temporal changes
               in a target population or resource condition they may not
               identify the mechanism influencing a change in an ecosystem or
               an entity. A key remaining challenge is to develop much improved
               mandated monitoring programs through more widespread adoption of
               the features of successful question-driven monitoring programs
               in efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation and
               environmental management.",

  abstract  = "AbstractAimAmazonia hosts more tree species from numerous
               evolutionary lineages, both young and ancient, than any other
               biogeographic region. Previous studies have shown that tree
               lineages colonized multiple edaphic environments and dispersed
               widely across Amazonia, leading to a hypothesis, which we test,
               that lineages should not be strongly associated with either
               geographic regions or edaphic forest
               types.LocationAmazonia.TaxonAngiosperms (Magnoliids; Monocots;
               Eudicots).MethodsData for the abundance of 5082 tree species in
               1989 plots were combined with a mega‐phylogeny. We applied
               evolutionary ordination to assess how phylogenetic composition
               varies across Amazonia. We used variation partitioning and
               Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) to test and quantify the separate
               and joint contributions of spatial and environmental variables
               to explain the phylogenetic composition of plots. We tested the
               indicator value of lineages for geographic regions and edaphic
               forest types and mapped associations onto the
               phylogeny.ResultsIn the terra firme and v{\'a}rzea forest types,
               the phylogenetic composition varies by geographic region, but
               the igap{\'o} and white‐sand forest types retain a unique
               evolutionary signature regardless of region. Overall, we find
               that soil chemistry, climate and topography explain 24\% of the
               variation in phylogenetic composition, with 79\% of that
               variation being spatially structured (R2 = 19\% overall for
               combined spatial/environmental effects). The phylogenetic
               composition also shows substantial spatial patterns not related
               to the environmental variables we quantified (R2 = 28\%). A
               greater number of lineages were significant indicators of
               geographic regions than forest types.Main ConclusionNumerous
               tree lineages, including some ancient ones (>66 Ma), show strong
               associations with geographic regions and edaphic forest types of
               Amazonia. This shows that specialization in specific edaphic
               environments has played a long‐standing role in the evolutionary
               assembly of Amazonian forests. Furthermore, many lineages, even
               those that have dispersed across Amazonia, dominate within a
               specific region, likely because of phylogenetically conserved
               niches for environmental conditions that are prevalent within
               regions.",

               colonisation during forest restoration in the tropics. We

               along a gradient of forest restoration in an Afro-tropical moist
               forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The restoration forests
               ranged from 3 to 16 years of age. We placed five traps in each
               of the eight forests along the restoration gradient and sampled
               butterflies for three days monthly for 12 months, beginning in
               May 2011. We (1) tested for the directional pattern in butterfly
               species richness, abundance, diversity, dominance and community
               composition from the youngest restoration to primary forests,
               (2) assessed the temporal and spatial patterns in butterfly
               community composition along the restoration gradient, (3)
               assessed the change in similarity between restoration and
               primary forests along the gradient, to estimate the time needed
               for recovery, and (4) determined specialist species
               characterising each forest age group. We recorded 10,092
               individuals, representing 79 species. Butterfly species
               richness, abundance and diversity increased with age since
               restoration started. There was a remarkable temporal variation
               in butterfly community composition. The similarity of the
               butterfly community to that of primary forests increased
               linearly with time, without reaching an asymptote. We estimate
               that fruit-feeding butterfly communities of restored tropical
               forests can be similar to that of primary forests within 40
               years, provided that primary forests are nearby. Our results
               demonstrate that tropical forest restoration aids the recovery
               of butterfly communities to their pre-disturbance states and
               probably aids biodiversity as a whole.",

  abstract  = "The seasonal flood pulse in Amazonia can be considered a primary
               driver of community structure in floodplain environments.
               Although this natural periodic disturbance is part of the
               landscape dynamics, the seasonal inundation presents a
               considerable challenge to organisms that inhabit floodplain
               forests. The present study investigated the effect of seasonal
               flooding on fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in different
               forest types and strata in central Amazonia. We sampled
               fruit-feeding butterflies in the canopy and the understory using
               baited traps in adjacent upland (unflooded forests-terra firme),
               white and blackwater floodplain forests (v{\'a}rzea and
               igap{\'o}, respectively) during the low- and high-water seasons.
               Butterfly abundance decreased in the high-water season,
               especially of dominant species in v{\'a}rzea, but the number of
               species was similar between seasons in the three forest types.
               Species composition differed between strata in all forest types.
               However, the flood pulse only affected butterfly assemblages in
               v{\'a}rzea forest. The $\beta$-diversity components also
               differed only in v{\'a}rzea. Species replacement (turnover)
               dominated the spatial $\beta$-diversity in igap{\'o} and terra
               firme in both seasons and v{\'a}rzea in the high-water season.
               Nonetheless, nestedness was relatively higher in v{\'a}rzea
               forests during the low-water season, mainly due to the effect of
               dominant species. These results emphasize the importance of
               seasonal flooding to structure butterfly assemblages in
               floodplain forests and reveal the idiosyncrasy of butterfly
               community responses to flooding in different forest types. Our
               results also suggest that any major and rapid changes to the
               hydrological regime could severely affect floodplain communities
               adapted to this natural seasonal hydrological cycle, threatening
               the existence of these unique environments.",

               and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations
               can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary
               observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring
               schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing.
               We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal
               coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring
               schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to
               deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the
               latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes
               mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver
               long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite
               remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information
               on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data
               sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity
               datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources
               and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps.
               We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living
               Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on
               EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring
               schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and
               North America and that ecological field studies play a key role
               in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will
               depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through
               data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the
               establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical
               data gaps.",

  abstract  = "Amazonia has been a focus of interest since the early days of
               biogeography as an intrinsically complex and extremely diverse
               region. This region comprises an intricate mosaic that includes
               diverse types of forest formations, flooded environments and
               open vegetation. Increased knowledge about the distribution of
               species in Amazonia has led to the recognition of complex
               biogeographic patterns. The confrontation of these biogeographic
               patterns with information on the geological and climatic history
               of the region has generated several hypotheses dedicated to
               explain the origin of the biological diversity. Genomic
               information, coupled with knowledge of Earth's history,
               especially the evolution of the Amazonian landscape, presents
               fascinating possibilities for understanding the mechanisms that
               govern the origin and maintenance of diversity patterns in one
               of the most diverse regions of the world. For this we will
               increasingly need more intense and coordinated interactions
               between researchers studying biotic diversification and the
               evolution of landscapes. From the interaction between these two
               fields of knowledge that are in full development, an
               increasingly detailed understanding of the historical mechanisms

  abstract  = "Abstract More than 15\% of global terrestrial area is under some
               form of protection and there is a growing impetus to increase
               this coverage to 30\% by 2030. But not all protection is
               effective and the reasons some countries' protected areas (PAs)
               are more effective than others' are poorly understood. We
               evaluate the effectiveness of national PA networks established
               between 2000 and 2012 globally in avoiding forest loss, taking
               into account underlying deforestation threats using a
               combination of matching methods and cross-sectional regressions.
               We then assess which demographic, agricultural, economic, and
               governance factors are most strongly associated with national PA
               effectiveness using machine learning methods. We estimate that
               national PAs established between 2000 and 2012 reduced
               deforestation in those areas by 72\%, avoiding 86 062 km2 of
               forest loss. The effectiveness of national PAs varied by
               strictness of protection based on International Union for
               Conservation of Nature category. Strictly PAs reduced forest
               loss by 81\% compared to what would have occurred without
               protection, while less strictly PAs reduced forest loss by 67\%.
               Thus, the 26\% of new PAs that were strictly protected
               contributed 39\% of the total forest loss avoided within PAs
               between 2000 and 2012. If every country's PAs were as effective
               as the country with the most effective PAs within the same
               region, they would have increased the area of deforestation
               avoided by 38\%, saving a further 119 082 km2 of forest. Part of
               the variation in PA effectiveness across countries is explained
               by the placement of PA in areas facing higher deforestation
               threat. Countries with lower agricultural activity, higher
               economic growth and better governance are most strongly
               associated with greater country-level PA effectiveness.",
