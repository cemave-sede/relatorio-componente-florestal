               insect seasonality in the Amazon region. However, few studies
               have analyzed the temporal dynamics of fruit-feeding butterflies
               in the Brazilian Amazon, specially in its eastern portion. Here,
               we evaluated the diversity patterns and temporal distribution of
               fruit-feeding butterflies in a remnant of eastern Amazon forest
               in the Baixada Maranhense, northeastern Brazil. Specifically, we
               tested whether fruit-feeding butterflies are temporally
               structured and whether rainfall influences species richness and
               abundance. Butterflies were collected with baited traps in both
               the rainy and dry seasons for two consecutive years. In total,
               we captured 493 butterflies belonging to 28 species, 15 genera
               and eight tribes. Three species comprised about half of the
               overall abundance, and Satyrinae was the most representative
               subfamily. The fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage showed a
               strong temporal structure during the second year of sampling,
               but not during the first year. Species composition and richness
               did not differ between rainy and dry seasons, and neither
               abundance nor richness was influenced by rainfall. Our results
               indicate that seasonality is not a strong environmental filter
               in this region, and that other biotic and abiotic factors are
               probably driving the community structure. The predominance of
               palms in the Baixada Maranhense, which are used as host plants
               by larvae of several lepidopteran species (specially satyrines)
               and are available year-round, might have contributed to the
               observed patterns of temporal diversity.",

               plantations are becoming increasingly widespread land‐uses in
               the tropics. Previous studies are divided on the conservation
               importance of these habitats for tropical forest butterflies.We
               use a robust sampling design, accounting for both seasonality
               and vertical stratification, to examine fruit‐feeding
               butterflies (Nymphalidae) in patches of secondary forest
               andEucalyptusplantation 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than
               those previously sampled.We recorded 10 587 butterflies and 128
               species in 3200 trap‐days. Species richness was highest in
               primary forest and lowest in plantations, while butterfly
               abundance showed the opposite response. All habitats were
               distinct in terms of community structure.There was a significant
               interaction between habitat and season based on richness and
               abundance metrics, although not based on community structure.
               Secondary forest exhibited higher observed richness than primary
               forest in the peak of the dry‐season, but not at other times of
               the year. This observation could explain the lack of consensus
               in previous studies, as those reporting higher richness in
               secondary forest only sampled during the dry‐season.In general,
               habitat quality appeared to be more important than the
               surrounding landscape in determining butterfly community
               structure. However, the community structure of the strong‐flying
               Charaxinae was related to the amount of primary forest in
               surrounding landscape. There was very poor congruence between
               the response patterns of richness and abundance among different
               butterfly subfamilies.Linear regressions between resource
               availability and butterfly abundance showed a strong influence
               of leaf phenology in both primary and secondary forest, but no
               influence of fruit phenology.Synthesis and applications: A lack
               of seasonal replication and small sampling sizes may have led
               previous studies to over‐emphasize the conservation importance
               of secondary forest and plantations for butterflies. We show
               that these habitats are significantly poorer than primary forest
               in terms of number of species, and hold distinct butterfly
               communities. Although quantifying the number of species
               restricted to primary forest remains difficult, these results
               cast doubt on the presumption that secondary habitats will
               provide refuge for many of the species being lost through
               deforestation. We therefore strongly urge measures that
               prioritize the conservation of remaining primary forests where
               they still exist.",

  abstract  = "Roughly 90\% of butterfly species live in the tropics. Despite
               this, we know very little about tropical butterfly ecology
               particularly when compared to temperate butterfly systems. The
               relative scarcity of data on tropical butterfly populations
               hampers our ability to effectively conserve them. In this review
               we summarize recurring themes from ecological research on
               tropical butterflies to serve as a framework for understanding
               their conservation. Key themes include: (1) the tropics
               represent the evolutionary origins of butterfly diversity, (2)
               while some tropical butterflies exhibit relatively stable
               population dynamics, longer-lived adult stages, and more
               continuous age-specific reproduction compared to temperate zone
               species, the generality of these patterns is debatable, and (3)
               complex species interactions (e.g. mimicry, parasitism and
               predation) can have significantly greater influences on
               ecological and evolutionary processes in tropical butterflies
               than in temperate ones. This state of ecological knowledge,
               combined with scarce resources, has traditionally constrained
               tropical butterfly conservation efforts to habitat level
               approaches, unlike the species- and population-specific
               approaches familiar in North America and Europe. Consequently,
               much conservation research on butterflies in the tropics has
               focused on the relationship between habitat quality (e.g. forest
               fragmentation) and butterfly diversity, though predictive
               patterns even in this regard remain elusive. We argue that with
               the increasing threats of habitat destruction, fragmentation and
               climate change, it is necessary to move beyond this diversity
               and habitat relationship if we are to improve predictive
               capabilities when evaluating anthropogenic impacts on tropical
               butterfly communities. Tropical butterflies are more than just
               useful indicator species. They represent some of the most
               spectacular and visually appealing organisms in the world and
               play many vital roles in tropical ecosystems. We hope that this
               synthesis will lay the groundwork for future ecological studies
               of tropical butterfly populations, species, communities and

               different bamboo life stages. False-color composites from
               orbital sensors going back to 1975 are capable of distinguishing
               life stages. These woody bamboos flower produce massive
               quantities of seeds and then die. Life stage is synchronized,
               forming a single cohort within each population. Bamboo dominates
               at least 161,500 km(2) of forest, coincident with an area of
               recent or ongoing tectonic uplift, rapid mechanical erosion and
               poorly drained soils rich in exchangeable cations. Each bamboo
               population is confined to a single spatially continuous patch or
               to a core patch with small outliers. Using spatial congruence
               between pairs of mature-stage maps from different years, we
               estimate an average life cycle of 27-28 y. It is now possible to
               predict exactly where and approximately when new bamboo

               bamboo-dominated forest. Population size averaged 330 km(2).
               Flowering events of these populations are temporally and/or
               spatially separated, restricting or preventing gene exchange.
               Nonetheless, adjacent populations flower closer in time than
               expected by chance, forming flowering waves. This may be a
               consequence of allochronic divergence from fewer ancestral

               partitions can differ in their contribution to overall species
               diversity. 2. In the Neotropics, the Central American butterfly
               fauna is best known in terms of general natural history, but
               butterfly community diversity is best documented by studies on

               that long-term sampling is vital to understanding tropical

  abstract  = "AbstractThe diverse, largely Neotropical subtribe Euptychiina is
               widely regarded as one of the most taxonomically challenging
               groups among all butterflies. Over the last two decades,
               morphological and molecular studies have revealed widespread
               paraphyly and polyphyly among genera, and a comprehensive,
               robust phylogenetic hypothesis is needed to build a firm generic
               classification to support ongoing taxonomic revisions at the
               species level. Here, we generated a dataset that includes
               sequences for up to nine nuclear genes and the mitochondrial COI
               `barcode' for a total of 1280 specimens representing 449
               described and undescribed species of Euptychiina and 39
               out‐groups, resulting in the most complete phylogeny for the
               subtribe to date. In combination with a recently developed
               genomic backbone tree, this dataset resulted in a topology with
               strong support for most branches. We recognize eight major
               clades that each contain two or more genera, together containing
               all but seven Euptychiina genera. We provide a summary of the
               taxonomy, diversity and natural history of each clade, and
               discuss taxonomic changes implied by the phylogenetic results.
               We describe nine new genera to accommodate 38 described species:
               Lazulina Willmott, Nakahara \& Espeland, gen.n., Saurona Huertas
               \& Willmott, gen.n., Argentaria Huertas \& Willmott, gen.n.,
               Taguaiba Freitas, Zacca \& Siewert, gen.n., Xenovena Mar{\'\i}n
               \& Nakahara, gen.n., Deltaya Willmott, Nakahara \& Espeland,
               gen.n., Modica Zacca, Casagrande \& Willmott, gen.n., Occulta
               Nakahara \& Willmott, gen.n., and Trico Nakahara \& Espeland,
               gen.n. We also synonymize Nubila Viloria, Andrade \& Henao, 2019
               (syn.n.) with Splendeuptychia Forster, 1964, Macrocissia
               Viloria, Le Crom \& Andrade, 2019 (syn.n.) with Satyrotaygetis
               Forster, 1964, and Rudyphthimoides Viloria, 2022 (syn.n.) with
               Malaveria Viloria \& Benmesbah, 2020. Overall, we revised the
               generic placement of 79 species (74 new generic combinations and
               five revised combinations), and as a result all but six
               described species of Euptychiina are accommodated within 70
               named, monophyletic genera. For all newly described genera, we
               provide illustrations of representative species, drawings of
               wing venation and male and (where possible) female genitalia,
               and distribution maps, and summarize the natural history of the
               genus. For three new monotypic genera, Occulta gen.n., Trico
               gen.n. and Xenovena gen.n. we provide a taxonomic revision with
               a review of the taxonomy of each species and data from examined

  abstract  = "This study investigated the spatial distribution of an Amazonian
               fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage by linking species taxonomic
               and functional approaches. We hypothesized that: 1) vegetation
               richness (i.e., resources) and abundance of insectivorous birds
               (i.e., predators) should drive changes in butterfly taxonomic
               composition, 2) larval diet breadth should decrease with
               increase of plant species richness, 3) small-sized adults should
               be favored by higher abundance of birds, and 4) communities with
               eyespot markings should be able to exploit areas with higher
               predation pressure. Fruit-feeding butterflies were sampled with
               bait traps and insect nets across 25 km(2) of an Amazonian
               ombrophilous forest in Brazil. We measured larval diet breadth,
               adult body size, and wing marking of all butterflies. Our
               results showed that plant species richness explained most of the
               variation in butterfly taxonomic turnover. Also, community
               average diet breadth decreased with increase of plant species
               richness, which supports our expectations. In contrast,
               community average body size increased with the abundance of
               birds, refuting our hypothesis. We detected no influence of
               environmental gradients on the occurrence of species with
               eyespot markings. The association between butterfly taxonomic
               and functional composition points to a mediator role of the
               functional traits in the environmental filtering of butterflies.
               The incorporation of the functional approach into the analyses
               allowed for the detection of relationships that were not
               observed using a strictly taxonomic perspective and provided an

  abstract  = "AbstractNewly discovered species are often threatened with
               extinction but in many cases have received limited conservation
               effort. To guide future conservation, it is important to
               determine the extinction risk of newly described species. Here,
               we test how time since formal description of a species is linked
               to its threat status to obtain a better insight into the
               possible threat status of newly described species and as yet
               undescribed species. We compiled IUCN Red List data for 53,808
               species from five vertebrate groups described since 1758.
               Extinction risk for more recently described species has
               increased significantly over time; the proportion of threatened
               species among newly described species has increased from 11.9\%
               for species described between 1758 and 1767 to 30.0\% for those
               described between 2011 and 2020. Based on projections from our
               analysis, this could further increase to 47.1\% by 2050. The
               pattern is consistent across vertebrate taxonomic groups and
               biomes. Current species extinction rates estimated from data of
               all known species are therefore highly likely to be

  abstract  = "AbstractAimAmazonia hosts more tree species from numerous
               evolutionary lineages, both young and ancient, than any other
               biogeographic region. Previous studies have shown that tree
               lineages colonized multiple edaphic environments and dispersed
               widely across Amazonia, leading to a hypothesis, which we test,
               that lineages should not be strongly associated with either
               geographic regions or edaphic forest
               types.LocationAmazonia.TaxonAngiosperms (Magnoliids; Monocots;
               Eudicots).MethodsData for the abundance of 5082 tree species in
               1989 plots were combined with a mega‐phylogeny. We applied
               evolutionary ordination to assess how phylogenetic composition
               varies across Amazonia. We used variation partitioning and
               Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) to test and quantify the separate
               and joint contributions of spatial and environmental variables
               to explain the phylogenetic composition of plots. We tested the
               indicator value of lineages for geographic regions and edaphic
               forest types and mapped associations onto the
               phylogeny.ResultsIn the terra firme and v{\'a}rzea forest types,
               the phylogenetic composition varies by geographic region, but
               the igap{\'o} and white‐sand forest types retain a unique
               evolutionary signature regardless of region. Overall, we find
               that soil chemistry, climate and topography explain 24\% of the
               variation in phylogenetic composition, with 79\% of that
               variation being spatially structured (R2 = 19\% overall for
               combined spatial/environmental effects). The phylogenetic
               composition also shows substantial spatial patterns not related
               to the environmental variables we quantified (R2 = 28\%). A
               greater number of lineages were significant indicators of
               geographic regions than forest types.Main ConclusionNumerous
               tree lineages, including some ancient ones (>66 Ma), show strong
               associations with geographic regions and edaphic forest types of
               Amazonia. This shows that specialization in specific edaphic
               environments has played a long‐standing role in the evolutionary
               assembly of Amazonian forests. Furthermore, many lineages, even
               those that have dispersed across Amazonia, dominate within a
               specific region, likely because of phylogenetically conserved
               niches for environmental conditions that are prevalent within
               regions.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Hydropower in the Brazilian Amazon is a prevalent form
               of development, but dams have widespread and long-term
               environmental impacts that include deforestation in the areas
               surrounding the dams. Small hydropower plants (SHPs) are often
               perceived as having reduced environmental impacts compared to
               the large ones. In Brazil, SHPs are licensed by state
               governments, which have less strict requirements than the
               federal environmental agency. Brazil's definition of `small'
               dams has grown with successive increases in the maximum
               installed capacity from 10 to 30 to 50 megawatts (MW). This
               expanding loophole has increased the attractiveness of investing
               in multiple small dams rather than a single large dam, with
               resulting proliferation of SHPs. Forest dynamics surrounding the
               clustered SHPs when compared to single large dams are not well
               documented. In this study, we capitalized on a dense time series
               of satellite images to quantify and compare forest loss in the
               regions (over 110 000 km2 in area) surrounding 15 SHPs and 7
               large dams at multiple watershed and buffer scales in the
               Brazilian Amazon for nearly two decades (2000--2018). The
               landscapes containing SHP clusters had lower cumulative forest
               loss as compared to those with large dams. However, when
               deforestation and hydroelectric generating capacity were jointly
               considered (i.e. forest loss per megawatt installed), we
               discovered an opposite trend. The regions surrounding the SHP
               clusters exhibited significant impacts ranging from 1.9 to 2.5
               times that of the regions surrounding large dams across 5 km to
               sub-basin scales. Due to the considerable consequences of SHPs
               on deforestation, we argue that the rapid expansion of small
               hydropower should be approached with caution and requires more
               stringent environmental assessments.",

               butterflies for three days monthly for 12 months, beginning in
               May 2011. We (1) tested for the directional pattern in butterfly
               species richness, abundance, diversity, dominance and community
               composition from the youngest restoration to primary forests,
               (2) assessed the temporal and spatial patterns in butterfly

               assessed the change in similarity between restoration and

               for recovery, and (4) determined specialist species
               characterising each forest age group. We recorded 10,092

               years, provided that primary forests are nearby. Our results
               demonstrate that tropical forest restoration aids the recovery

               forest type and seasonally flooded forests inundated by white-
               and black-water rivers (v{\'a}rzea and igap{\'o}, respectively)
               represent around 20\% of the forested areas. In this work, we
               took advantage of a natural spatial arrangement of the main
               vegetation types in central Amazonia to investigate butterfly
               assemblage structure in terra firme, v{\'a}rzea and igap{\'o}

               v{\'a}rzea forest provided the highest number of butterfly

               that this forest type is floristically richer than v{\'a}rzea

               unique to a single forest type and 17 can be considered forest

               driver of community structure in floodplain environments.
               Although this natural periodic disturbance is part of the
               landscape dynamics, the seasonal inundation presents a
               considerable challenge to organisms that inhabit floodplain
               forests. The present study investigated the effect of seasonal
               flooding on fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in different
               forest types and strata in central Amazonia. We sampled
               fruit-feeding butterflies in the canopy and the understory using
               baited traps in adjacent upland (unflooded forests-terra firme),
               white and blackwater floodplain forests (v{\'a}rzea and
               igap{\'o}, respectively) during the low- and high-water seasons.
               Butterfly abundance decreased in the high-water season,
               especially of dominant species in v{\'a}rzea, but the number of
               species was similar between seasons in the three forest types.
               Species composition differed between strata in all forest types.
               However, the flood pulse only affected butterfly assemblages in
               v{\'a}rzea forest. The $\beta$-diversity components also
               differed only in v{\'a}rzea. Species replacement (turnover)
               dominated the spatial $\beta$-diversity in igap{\'o} and terra
               firme in both seasons and v{\'a}rzea in the high-water season.
               Nonetheless, nestedness was relatively higher in v{\'a}rzea
               forests during the low-water season, mainly due to the effect of
               dominant species. These results emphasize the importance of

  abstract  = "A method based on transect count has been developed to assess
               changes in abundance of butterflies from year to year. The
               method involves weekly walks around atransect route making
               counts of butterflies seen within defined limits. The transects
               are divided into sections related to habitat or management
               units. Walks are made only when weather conditions satisfy
               specified minimum requirements. The method has been tested for
               three years at Monks Wood and for two years at a number of other
               sites.The basis for annual comparisons is an index of abundance
               which is produced for each brood of each species, except when
               separation of broods is not possible. This index is correlated
               with abundance, although the precise nature of the relationship
               will vary from species to species. Evidence on this presented
               for two species.The method makes it possible to monitor the
               abundance of butterflies at selected sites, using recorders,
               such as nature reserve wardens, who can fit in one or two hours
               recording each week when the weather is suitable. Such a scheme,
               based on the methods described in this paper, began in 1976. In
               addition to the monitoring of fluctuations of abundance, the
               method provides considerable information on the phenology and
               ecology of butterflies. The division of the transects into
               sections makes some assessment of the effects of habitat change,
               due to management or other factors, possible.",

  abstract  = "Amazonia has been a focus of interest since the early days of
               biogeography as an intrinsically complex and extremely diverse
               region. This region comprises an intricate mosaic that includes
               diverse types of forest formations, flooded environments and
               open vegetation. Increased knowledge about the distribution of
               species in Amazonia has led to the recognition of complex
               biogeographic patterns. The confrontation of these biogeographic
               patterns with information on the geological and climatic history
               of the region has generated several hypotheses dedicated to
               explain the origin of the biological diversity. Genomic
               information, coupled with knowledge of Earth's history,
               especially the evolution of the Amazonian landscape, presents
               fascinating possibilities for understanding the mechanisms that
               govern the origin and maintenance of diversity patterns in one
               of the most diverse regions of the world. For this we will
               increasingly need more intense and coordinated interactions
               between researchers studying biotic diversification and the
               evolution of landscapes. From the interaction between these two
               fields of knowledge that are in full development, an
               increasingly detailed understanding of the historical mechanisms
               related to the origin of the species will surely arise.",
